<h3>SolarConquest</h3>

A game based on allocating ships from your home planet to attack and conquer other planets! In this game, it's a race
against the clock to conquer the map before your time runs out! Grey planets are neutral, and pose no resistance to you,
but red planets are hostile, and will fight back as you send forces to conquer their planet. What's more, even after you
conquer a red planet, the indigenous forces will rebel, and slowly deplete your forces allocated to that planet. It's up to you
to manage your ships and resources wisely to take over the galaxy!
